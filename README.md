# Project - Tic Tac Toe

This is a project to recreate the classic tic-tac-toe game proposed by the discipline of Programming Language Paradigms, which was developed using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project rules:
 - Main function to start/end the game when the user requests it.
 - At each move, the program calls a function to check if there was a winner.
 - Each play must show the status of the updated board and when starting a new game, the board is erased.

## ‚úñÔ∏è‚≠ï About the game:
In tic-tac-toe, two players alternate between placing their marks, usually "X" and "O", on a 3x3 board. The player who manages to form a line, column or diagonals with their marks wins the game.

## üéÆ Features

- Tic-tac-toe for two players.
- Change board color with victory.
- Restart when clicking the button after one of the players wins.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play
1. Access the link [TIC Tac Toe](https://jonathanspereira.github.io/projeto-jogo-da-velha/)

2. Two players must alternate between clicking on empty cells on the board to place their marks ("X" or "O").

3. The game continues until a player forms a row, column or diagonal with their marks or until all cells on the board are filled.

4. When a player wins, a message stating who won appears on the screen.

5. When you click on the Restart button, the game restarts.
