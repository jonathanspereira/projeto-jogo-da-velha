# Project - Jogo da velha

Project proposed by the programming paradigms discipline.

 ## Rules:
     - Main function to start/end the game when the user requests it.
     - At each move, the program calls a function to check if there was a winner.
     - Each play must show the status of the updated board and when starting a new game, the board is erased.
